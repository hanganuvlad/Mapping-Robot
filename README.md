Built an Autonomous Car Robot (hardware and software) helping bomb disposal experts mapping the hazardous environments by following the wall structures with image recognition algorithms and filters.

Implemented the solution with Python for Raspberry PI using CV2 and Numpy libraries and C++ with Arduino for hardware acquisitions and engine actuators
